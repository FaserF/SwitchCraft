# Installing SwitchCraft as an App (PWA)

SwitchCraft is a modern web application that supports **Progressive Web App (PWA)** technology. This allows you to install it on your device and use it like a native application, without going through an app store.

## Prerequisites

To install SwitchCraft, you need access to one of the following:

1.  **SwitchCraft Demo**: The official demo hosted on GitHub Pages.
2.  **Self-Hosted SwitchCraft**: A running Docker instance of SwitchCraft (Web Mode).

## Installation Steps

### Android (Chrome / Edge)
1.  Open the SwitchCraft URL in **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge**.
2.  Tap the **Examples** (three dots) menu in the top right corner.
3.  Tap **"Install App"** or **"Add to Home screen"**.
4.  Confirm the installation by tapping **"Install"**.
5.  Wait a moment. The **SwitchCraft** icon will appear on your home screen and app drawer.

### iOS / iPadOS (Safari)
1.  Open the SwitchCraft URL in **Safari**.
2.  Tap the **Share** button (rectangle with an arrow pointing up) at the bottom of the screen.
3.  Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**.
4.  Review the name (e.g., "SwitchCraft Demo") and tap **"Add"** in the top right corner.
5.  The app icon will appear on your home screen.

### Windows / macOS / Linux (Chrome / Edge)
1.  Open the SwitchCraft URL in **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge**.
2.  Look for the **"Install SwitchCraft"** icon (a computer with a down arrow) in the address bar (right side).
3.  Click the icon and select **"Install"**.
4.  The app will launch in its own window. You can pin it to your Taskbar (Windows) or Dock (macOS) for easy access.

## Features
- **Standalone Experience**: Runs without the browser address bar and controls.
- **Fast Access**: Launch directly from your home screen or desktop.
- **Always Up-to-Date**: The app automatically uses the latest version from your server.

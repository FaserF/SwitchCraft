# Dashboard

The **Dashboard** offers deeper analytics into your packaging ecosystem than the simple Home view.

## Metrics
*   **Total Apps Managed**: Count of apps detected in your local library and Intune tenant.
*   **Success Rate**: (Experimental) Success vs. Failure rate of your recent Intune deployments based on status reports.
*   **Storage Usage**: Local storage used by your package repository.

## Visualizations
*   **Package Types**: Breakdown of MSI vs. EXE vs. Script packages.
*   **Activity Trend**: A graph showing your packaging volume over the last 30 days.

*Note: This view heavily relies on the History Service. If you clear your history, these metrics will reset.*

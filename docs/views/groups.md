# Group Manager

The **Group Manager** allow you to interact with Azure Active Directory (Entra ID) groups without leaving the application. This is crucial for assigning apps to specific user collections.

## Features
*   **Search**: Find groups by name.
*   **Create**: Create new Security Groups (Static) directly from the UI.
*   **Members**: View and manage members of a group.
    *   *Add Member*: Search for users/devices and add them.
    *   *Remove Member*: Kick users from the group.
*   **Sync**: Force a delta sync (if supported) to refresh membership view.

## Usage in Packaging
When you upload an app in the **Analyzer** or **Wizard**, you can select groups from this list availability or requirement assignments. Keeping your groups organized here makes targeting deployments much faster.

# Intune Packager

The **Intune Packager** is a graphical wrapper for the Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool (`IntuneWinAppUtil.exe`). It converts standard application installers into the `.intunewin` format required for Microsoft Intune Win32 App deployment.

## Purpose
Microsoft Intune requires Win32 apps to be encapsulated in an encrypted `.intunewin` container. This view streamlines the creation of these containers without needing command-line arguments.

## Interface Overview

### 1. Source Selection
*   **Source Folder**: The directory containing all files needed for installation.
    *   *Tip: This should include the installer, any scripts (Install.ps1), and config files.*
*   **Setup File**: The main executable that Intune will launch (e.g., `setup.exe` or `Install-App.ps1`).
    *   *Must be located inside the Source Folder.*

### 2. Output Configuration
*   **Output Folder**: Where the resulting `.intunewin` file will be saved.
*   **Catalog Folder (Optional)**: If you need to include a catalog file usually for Windows S Mode support.

### 3. Actions
*   **Create Package**: Validates inputs and runs the `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe` process in the background.
    *   *A progress bar will show the status of compression and encryption.*
*   **Reset**: Clears all fields.

## Dependencies
*   **IntuneWinAppUtil.exe**: Use the internal copy managed by SwitchCraft. If missing, SwitchCraft will attempt to download it automatically.

## Best Practices
1.  **Always use a clean Source Folder**: Do not point "Source Folder" to your Downloads folder! Create a dedicated folder (e.g., `C:\Packaging\MyApp\v1.0`) containing ONLY the files for this specific app.
2.  **Use PowerShell Wrappers**: Instead of pointing Setup File to the `.exe`, point it to a `Install.ps1` script (generated by the Analyzer or Helper). This gives you more control over logging and error handling.

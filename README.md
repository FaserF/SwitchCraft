## ⚠️ Platform Support & Limitations

SwitchCraft is primarily designed for **Windows** environments. While the application UI is built with cross-platform frameworks (Python/Flet), many core features rely on Windows-specific APIs (Registry, Explorer, Intune Packaging Tool).

| Feature | Windows | macOS / Linux | Reason / Limitation |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Modern UI** | ✅ | ✅ | Runs natively via Flet (Flutter). |
| **Intune Packaging** | ✅ | ❌ | Requires `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe` (Windows binary). |
| **Configuration** | ✅ | ⚠️ | Full support via Registry (GPO/Intune). No local config file support yet. |
| **Winget Store** | ✅ | ❌ | Requires `winget` CLI (Windows native). |
| **System Integration** | ✅ | ⚠️ | Explorer integration, Notifications, and PowerShell features are Windows-only. |
| **Analyze Installer** | ✅ | ✅ | Basic file analysis works, but advanced PE analysis is Windows-native. |

> [!WARNING]
> **macOS and Linux users:** You can run the application to view the interface or analyze simple files, but you **cannot** create Intune packages or use Store features. These builds are essentially "Viewers" and are not actively supported.
